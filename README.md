## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux-based system for monitoring and managing hardware resources across multiple Linux hosts, collecting hardware specifications and usage metrics. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for analysis via SQL queries. The system is automated with Bash scripting, utilizes Regex for data filtering, and is containerized with Docker. Crontab schedules periodic data collection, while Git handles version control. Designed for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Developed a fast and efficient tool for searching text in large files. Built with Java, it leverages functional programming principles to make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. It uses regular expressions (Regex) for powerful pattern matching and applies streams and lambda expressions to process data efficiently. This makes it a great tool for anyone needing to search through text with precision and speed.

  - Stock Quote App: Implemented a Stock Quote App, built with Java and a PostgreSQL database, that integrates with the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time stock data. It uses OkHttpClient for efficient HTTP requests and Jackson for quick JSON deserialization. Designed with a robust architecture, the app ensures smooth and reliable data management, making it a powerful tool for tracking, practicing, and managing stock investments in a real-world-like environment, without any risks.
