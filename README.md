## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux-based system for monitoring and managing hardware resources across multiple Linux hosts, collecting hardware specifications and usage metrics. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for analysis via SQL queries. The system is automated with Bash scripting, utilizes Regex for data filtering, and is containerized with Docker. Crontab schedules periodic data collection, while Git handles version control. Designed for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java application leveraging JDBC to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. Designed DAOs for modular and efficient data access, used Maven for dependency and build management, and employed Docker to simplify setup and deployment. Performed comprehensive testing to ensure transaction accuracy, stability, and reliability.
  - Grep App: Developed a fast and efficient tool for searching text in large files. Built with Java, it leverages functional programming principles to make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. It uses regular expressions (Regex) for powerful pattern matching and applies streams and lambda expressions to process data efficiently. This makes it a great tool for anyone needing to search through text with precision and speed.

  - Stock Quote App: Implemented a Stock Quote App, built with Java and a PostgreSQL database, that integrates with the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time stock data. It uses OkHttpClient for efficient HTTP requests and Jackson for quick JSON deserialization. Designed with a robust architecture, the app ensures smooth and reliable data management, making it a powerful tool for tracking, practicing, and managing stock investments in a real-world-like environment, without any risks.

**PySpark Fundamentals** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/core_java)]: In this project, I learned the fundamentals of PySpark and applied them through hands-on implementation. The focus was on building ETL pipelines using Spark DataFrames within the Databricks environment. The project involved reading data from multiple sources, applying transformations, and preparing it for downstream use. It demonstrates practical data processing workflows using PySpark, with an emphasis on efficient querying and manipulation at scale.

**Spark Advanced** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AdhamElatris/tree/master/core_java)]: I implemented a retail data pipeline using PySpark to process and transform data from a CSV file. The project involved data cleaning, aggregation, and business analysis tasks such as invoice trends, monthly growth, active users, and RFM segmentation. Final insights were visualized with Matplotlib, demonstrating practical big data processing and analytics. This project deepened my understanding of Spark’s capabilities and real-world applications.


## Highlighted Projects
**Progression - A programming learning application**: Developed the comments feature for a coding education website used in multiple Quebec colleges, significantly improving communication between teachers and students. I used PHP Laravel, JavaScript, Vue.js and REST API.

**Matchez moi**: Led a team of four as SCRUM Master and developer for a dating website. The application won second-best of the semester and is showcased to incoming students. This project was built on Spring Boot, HTML (Thymeleaf), CSS and MariaDB database.

**Typing Speed Game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/aelatris/TypingGame)]: Developed a responsive typing game designed to help improve keyboard reactivity by testing users’ speed with random words. The game features customizable timers and difficulty settings, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a REST API.

**LoueMonChar** [[GitHub](https://github.com/aelatris/Api-location-auto)]: LoueMonChar is a Rest API designed for a mobile app that enables users to rent or list their vehicles. It facilitates data sharing with a car rental service, allowing users to find cars for rent or earn money by renting out their own, based on duration and model.
