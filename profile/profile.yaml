    description: Developed a Linux-based system for monitoring and managing hardware resources across multiple Linux hosts, collecting hardware specifications and usage metrics. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for analysis via SQL queries. The system is automated with Bash scripting, utilizes Regex for data filtering, and is containerized with Docker. Crontab schedules periodic data collection, while Git handles version control. Designed for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:       
      - "JDBC App: Developed a Java application leveraging JDBC to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. Designed DAOs for modular and efficient data access, used Maven for dependency and build management, and employed Docker to simplify setup and deployment. Performed comprehensive testing to ensure transaction accuracy, stability, and reliability."

      - "Grep App: Developed a fast and efficient tool for searching text in large files. Built with Java, it leverages functional programming principles to make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. It uses regular expressions (Regex) for powerful pattern matching and applies streams and lambda expressions to process data efficiently. This makes it a great tool for anyone needing to search through text with precision and speed.
